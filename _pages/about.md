I am currently a data mining engineer in financial industry, catering for building machine learning models to accomplish risk control, suspicious fraud recognition and anti-fraud behaviors. My interests lie in AI applications, hardware and software infrastructures, and want to further delve into **machine learning & deep learning**, **distributed systems**, **GPU-based architectures & applications**, as well as **high-performance computing**.

Previsouly, I obtained Master's degree in **Information Technology** from **HKUST**(**The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology**), where domains of AI and big data knowledge and techniques were introduced to me. During the academic year, I also worked in the Indoor Localization and Mobile Computing program, advised by [**Prof. Gary Shueng Han CHAN**](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/gary-shueng-han-chan), where I had the opportunity to apply IoT hardware and machine learning techniques to tackle real-world problems. Before graduation, I also took the internship in **Huawei 2012 lab** to study and optimize spark GraphX's partition strategy, where I first got hands-on experience in a distributed environment.

The rapid development in CS specialization always intrigues me to explore the endless possibility in related domains. With the aim of being an expert in AI specialization to be proficient in both hardware and software applications, I would like to grasp every chance to cultivate myself.
